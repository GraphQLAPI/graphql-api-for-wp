### New features + Instructional videos @ u$d 14/m

New features are made available following the _sponsorware_ model.

In the [sponsorware project](https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp/projects/2) are the requested features. Whenever Leo gets 10 new sponsors, development on the most up-voted (👍) feature starts. The new feature becomes immediately available to the sponsors via a private GitHub repo, and is integrated into the plugin once Leo gets 50 new sponsors.

Sponsors also get access to instructional videos, on topics such as:

- How to create a GraphQL schema
- Strategies for caching
- Improving performance
- Evolving the schema
